A mobile application developed with Flutter

This project was completed in an international school project with a dutch university.
Our project group of four created the frontend for the application, whereas the dutch students created the backend.

The Application:
- Users can create events: either live or online events
- The events would show on the map according to their location 
- Other users can sign up for the events
- Users in the same event can chat with each other and proceed to agree on the details 

Eventify.PNG shows the layout of the application
